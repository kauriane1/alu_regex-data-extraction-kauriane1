# Input Validator using Python and Regular Expressions

This project is a Python script that validates different types of user inputs using **regular expressions (regex)**. It is designed to help users test whether inputs like emails, phone numbers, URLs, hashtags, and more are valid.

## What It Validates

The program checks for the following 8 input types:

1. Email addresses  
2. URLs (web links)  
3. Phone numbers  
4. Credit card numbers  
5. Time (12-hour and 24-hour formats)  
6. HTML tags  
7. Hashtags  
8. Currency amounts (e.g., `$19.99`, `$1,234.56`)
